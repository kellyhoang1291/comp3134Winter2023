The storexss.txt contains a potentially malicious URL redirect statement (document.location.href="/directory_traversal_part1.php") 
that can be used for a directory traversal attack. 

If the contents of storexss.txt are later displayed on a web page without proper sanitization in the storexss.php script, 
it can result in the execution of this script on the web page. This can lead to the attacker being able to redirect users 
to a different web page (/directory_traversal_part1.php in this case), potentially allowing them to access sensitive files 
or perform other malicious activities on the server.
