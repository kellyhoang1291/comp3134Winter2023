1) There is no record return for Ben because the Ben is not active (active = 0) which is as expectation. 
2 & 3) Syntax violation: This error is likely caused by the single quote character (') in the input value "Ben'--". 
In SQL, single quotes are used as string delimiters, so when the input value contains a single quote, it can break the SQL query and result in a syntax error.
